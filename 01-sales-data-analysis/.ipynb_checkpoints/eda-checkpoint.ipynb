The multiple comparisons problem will arise because every time we compare two variables or see the sample distribution of a variable, we will essentially have performed a hypothesis test on it. As more and more hypothesis tests are run on a set of data, the more likely it is that a spurious correlation, or a correlation that has arisen purely due to coincidence and doesn't exist in reality, will be encountered. There are ways (corrections) to account for that (see the \"Controlling procedures\" section of the linked Wikipedia page), but a) it's not the same as having \"fresh\" data, and b) we are not particularly interested in testing any hypotheses at the moment. In fact, analyzing this data is largely what will _lead_ to hypotheses we want to test! We just won't be able to test them, unless we can get another set of data from the same store, collected the same way as this data."

    "What is most interesting is the product sales contribution chart in the context of the other two. Here are some observations:\n",
    "1. The batteries, charging cables, and wired headphones, which are very inexpensive and sold the most, contributed hardly anything to the yearly revenue.\n",
    "2. On the other hand, the Macbook Pro, iPhone, and ThinkPad laptop, which are the three most expensive and least ordered products, contributed the most to yearly revenue.\n",
    "3. The appliances are mid-range in terms of price but sold so few units that their combined contribution to yearly revenue was less than 3%.\n",
    "4. The 20in monitor is cheap, sold a meager number of units, and had a yearly revenue contribution of less than 2%.\n",
    "5. The Vareebadd phone (yes, yes &mdash; remember this isn't real world data, most store owners are hesitant to have their yearly numbers be known so we make do with what we have) isn't terribly expensive, but sold very few unuits and had a yearly revenue contribution of around 2.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we can make a few recommendations:\n",
    "1. Get rid of the appliances and focus exclusively on small electronics and their accessories.\n",
    "2. Get rid of the 20in monitor and Vareebadd phone and focus exclusively on brand name, high quality products.\n",
    "3. Things like batteries, charging cables, and wired headphones, though contributing very little to yearly revenue, are probably cheap enough to order in bulk and keep in stock, so maybe those things can be shown in a \"Recommended\" items section when the customer goes to checkout their order?\n",

    "Next, I want to plot the proportion of orders each product constitutes per month, as well as per state."
